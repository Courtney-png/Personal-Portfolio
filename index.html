                        Hi, my name is Courtney and I'm from England. I have a strong passion for both playing and making video games and love everything about it from<br>
                        conceptualisation to 3D Modelling, to Programming and Refining. I've known what I wanted to do for a lot of my life and have had enjoyed <br>
                        worldbuilding since I was very young, often planning out elaborate stories with many characters and adventures for them to go on. In college,<br>
                        I finally started combining this with my love for games and would start writing outlines of my own potential games.Though I still have a long<br>
                        way to go, the games industry and creating a game from nothing is truly an amazing experience and I would be so grateful working on a team <br>
                        with like-minded people.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Shiver</h2>
                    <p>Shiver is my third year group project in university. It's a 3D sci-fi horror game with a focus on keeping yourself warm whilst also being cautious of the unknown threat potentially around any corner.</p>

                    <p>A 2D creature collecting game where you must strategise to defeat other varieties whilst trying to figure out what has caused the current downfall of the world.With crafting, fighting and exploration, this is my current focus of my own.</p>

                    <p>My long term project. A lot of the inital planning has been done for it such as a Game Design Document as well as feedback and the core concepts iterated upon. The main focus for it is a 2D action adventure game with the priority being the boss fights and how they feel.</p>

                        <p>A personal piece. From concept to exporting, I drew then 3D modelled a dragon. As well as this I rigged it and provided it with a few basic animations.</p>

                        <p>A small snowy mountain level with focus on immersion. Feeling like you are truly there in the snowy, harsh environment. Planned everything from the height map to where the set dressings would go.</p>

                        <p>After seeing so many others making isometric rooms, I wanted to make my own cosy space. Sketched after my personal work space, I then 3D modelled each part and added some mood lighting.</p>
